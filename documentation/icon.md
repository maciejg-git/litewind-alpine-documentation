## Icon

The icons on this page, and those used in the components, come from my other project: [Icon Browser](https://iconbrowser.netlify.app/). 

It's a collection of icons from Bootstrap Icons, Material Design Icons, Font Awesome and Heroicons. All icons are standardized with the same attributes and can be styled directly with Tailwind classes, downloaded as SVG files, or pasted directly into your template.

Check it out if you'd like to replace any of the default icons or add new ones to your page.
