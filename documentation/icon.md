## Icon

The icons on this page and used in the components come from my other project [Icon Browser](https://iconbrowser.netlify.app/). Check it out if you want to replace any of the default icons or add new ones to your page.

The Icon Browser is a collection of icons from Bootstrap Icons, Material Design Icons, Font Awesome and Heroicons. All icons are unified to have the same set of attributes and can be styled directly with Tailwind classes, downloaded as SVG files or pasted directly to the template.
